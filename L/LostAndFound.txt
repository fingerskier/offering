  Verse 1:
    I was ^chasing my ref^lection  Calling ^shadows ^"home"
    Every ^trophy Every ^question Still I ^felt a^lone
    Thought my ^broken was just ^normal Called the ^darkness ^"light"
    I was ^breathing I was ^busy But my ^heart was ^blind

  Pre-Chorus:
    You were on the ^edges
    Of the life I ^planned
    Whisper in the ^wreckage
    Reaching out Your ^hand

  Chorus:
    I was 
    ^lost And I didn't even know it ^Running hard But my feet had nowhere to ^go You stepped into my story ^Tore the night wide open
    ^Now    I     see     Now     I ^know     Jesus    You    found    me    ^first                        ^You found me first

  Verse 2:
    All the ^noise became my ^shelter Every ^screen my ^friend
    I could ^quote a hundred ^answers But I ^missed the ^end
    You were ^there in every ^moment In the ^quiet ^ache
    ^Patient in the places ^I tried ^hard to ^fake

  Pre-Chorus:
    You were on the ^edges
    Of the life I ^drew
    Then You crossed the ^distance
    Said, "I'm chasing ^you"

  Bridge:
    ^You were in the hallway of my ^hurt  In the seat beside my ^shame  In the middle of my laughing  ^When I used Your holy name
    ^You were in the questions I ig^nored  In the tears I brushed a^way  I was calling it just life  You were calling it ^"come awake"
