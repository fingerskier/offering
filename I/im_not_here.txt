I'm not [G]here just to [C2]say Your name
	though the [Em]sound of Your name drives the [C]darkness away
I'm not [G]here just to [C2]crawl on my knees
	though in Your [Em]presence I cannot [C]stand
	
	Holy [G]Father, [D]ruler of the nations
	Fear of [Em]Isaac, who re[C]stores my dreams
	You have [G]lifted up Your [D]hand toward the nations
	And [Em]by the sacrifice [C]You made
	We are [G]here[D Em C]
	
I'm not [G]here just to [C2]speak Your word
	though the [Em]Word of God goes with power [C]and returns
I'm not [G]here for dis[C2]cussion of Your grace
	though every [Em]mention brings a tear of [C]joy to my face
	
	Holy [G]Savior, [D]Lamb of God
	Prince of [Em]Peace, [C]Word of Life
	Since [G]years ago [D]You've been lifted up
	And [Em]only by the sacrifice [C]You made
	
	We are [G]here
	
	to [C2]lift Your praise
		with our [Em]feeble voice we magni[D]fy Your name
	We are [G]here to [C2]spill our hearts	
		all our [Em]tiny efforts we [D]sacrifice
	We are [G]here to[C2]day
	We are [Em]here for [D]You
	
I'm not [G]here just to [C2]feel Your vibes
	though [Em]nothing in the world com[C]pares with Your touch
I'm not [G]here just to [C2]call on Your power
	though [Em]just Your fingertip can make the [D]mountains cower
	
	Holy [G]Ghost, perfect [D]Messenger
	PRecious [Em]Spirit, the One who [C]reconciles
	Won't You [G]lift our hearts and fix our [D]gaze forever
	For [Em]by Your work only do we [D]live
