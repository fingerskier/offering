Sections:

  Verse 1:

    ^waiting  for  the train   to ^come

    sitting ^solo on  the  platform   in  ^silence before the storm

    ^paths in the ^distance col^lide at the ho^rizon



  Verse 2:

    ^across the  tracks  into  the  ^desert

    ^long, black clouds ^always just behind

    ^weeping, ^trudging I ^push and pull just ^one more step





  Chorus 1:

    and I ^know    I ^know   

    ^there's a better ^life at the ^edge

    if I ^could leave myself be^hind

    the ^journey would be ^easier to ^make





  Verse 3:

    ^waiting   for   the   night   to    ^come

    blessed ^cool to quench the tempering of the ^day

    the ^stars should guide the ^way but the ^sky's changed since my ^youth





  Bridge:

    but the ^ripping of the wind

    and ^drowning of the rain

    what ^was I thinking stepping a^lone?

    

    and the ^calling of the dark is strong

    it ^pulls at me incessantly 

    where ^were you LORD at my inaugural ^steps?





  Chorus 2:

    and I ^know I ^know

    the ^better life is ^not in any ^sea

    if I ^could change the gait I ^walk

    the ^path would not wear ^me so easi^ly


  INSTRUMENTAL:


  EXIT:

    ^ waiting for the train to ^come

    ^the rain that washes also ^drowns

    ^ waiting for the train to ^come
