  VERSE 1:
    ^Sunday morning comes a^gain
    ^I leave my burdens at the ^door
    ^But inside are all the ^more
    I ^weep a^loud
    A la^ment for ^me

  CHORUS 1
    I ^cry  bloody ^tears   I ^mourn  and ^wail
    I ^cry  out to ^You   I ^pray  to You who ^saves

  VERSE 2:
    ^the journey seems the ^same
    ^Though the burden seems so ^new
    ^the sweat burns in my ^eyes
    ^my screaming burns my ^throat
    ^I weep, I know not for ^who

  CHORUS 1

    ^Your destination sought^
    Navigation a^chieved^
    ^my burden falls away^
    On the cross of Calva^ry^

  CHORUS 2
    I ^cry  tears of joy    And I praise  Your name
    I ^cry  out for ^You    who a^lone can ^save
